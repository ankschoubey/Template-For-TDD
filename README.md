### TDD Template for IntelliJ and VS Code

#### Available Abbreviations/Shortcuts:

- `@api`: Expands to a nested test class with a display name for a specific API endpoint.
- `@method`: Expands to a nested test class with a display name for a specific method.
- `@when`: Expands to a nested test class with a display name for a specific condition.
- `@then`: Expands to a test method with a display name for a specific assertion.

This template is designed to streamline Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices within IntelliJ IDEA and VS Code, making the process of writing tests and code more efficient and structured.

#### About the Template

This TDD template includes helpful shortcuts and structures to facilitate TDD practices, ensuring that your testing process is seamless and organized. The template consists of predefined snippets that can be easily expanded to create test classes and methods, following the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern commonly used in TDD.

#### How to Use

1. **Installation**: Download the `TDD-Templates-For-IntelliJ.zip` file.
   
2. **Import Settings in IntelliJ IDEA**:
   - Open IntelliJ IDEA.
   - Go to `File` > `Import Settings`.
   - Select the downloaded `TDD-Templates-For-IntelliJ.zip` file.
   - Follow the prompts to import the settings.

3. **Usage**: In your test classes, utilize the predefined snippets to structure your tests effectively.
   
   - `@api`: Expands to a nested test class with a display name for a specific API endpoint.
   
     ```java
     @Nested
     @DisplayName("GET /users")
     class GetUsersTest {
     
     }
     ```
   
   - `@method`: Expands to a nested test class with a display name for a specific method, with placeholders for method names.
   
     ```java
     @Nested
     @DisplayName("{userMethods} method")
     class {UserMethods}MethodTest {
     
     }
     ```
   
   - `@when`: Expands to a nested test class with a display name for a specific condition, with placeholders for condition descriptions.
   
     ```java
     @Nested
     @DisplayName("WHEN {condition description}")
     class {ConditionDescription}Tests {
     
     }
     ```
   
   - `@then`: Expands to a test method with a display name for a specific assertion, with placeholders for assertion descriptions.
   
     ```java
     @Test
     @DisplayName("THEN {assertion description}")
     void {AssertionDescription}Test() {
         // given
         {code for setting conditions describe in WHEN block}
     
         // when
         {code for running actions}
     
         // then
         {code for assertions}
     }
     ```
