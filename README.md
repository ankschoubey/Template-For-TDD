### Streamline Your Testing Process with a Clean TDD Template For IntelliJ

Writing clean and well-structured tests is essential for ensuring the reliability and maintainability of your codebase. The Test-Driven Development (TDD) Template for IntelliJ and VS Code provides a straightforward approach to creating tests that are easy to understand, maintain, and execute efficiently.

**Final Output**: 

```java
@Nested
@DisplayName("GET /users") // abbreviation `@api`
class GetUsersTest {
    @Nested
    @DisplayName("WHEN 'role' is 'user'") // abbreviation `@when`
    class WHENRoleIsUserTest {
        @Test
        @DisplayName("THEN SHOULD return 403") // abbreviation `@then`
        void THENTest() {
            // given
                LoggedInUser = Given.ALoggedInUserForRole("user");
            // when
                WebTestClient.ResponseSpec responseSpec = webTestClient.get().uri("/users").exchange();
            // then
                responseSpec.expectStatus().isUnauthorized();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Benefits of Using the Template

1. **Clarity and Readability**: By providing predefined snippets for test structure, the template ensures that your tests are easy to understand and follow, promoting clarity throughout your test suite.
   
2. **Efficiency**: With shortcuts for creating test classes and methods, you can speed up the process of writing tests, allowing you to focus more on testing your code's behavior rather than boilerplate setup.
   
3. **Consistency**: Adopting a standardized format for tests encourages consistency across your project, facilitating collaboration among team members and easing the burden of maintenance.

Start leveraging the TDD template today to streamline your testing process and elevate the quality of your software.

#### Available Abbreviations/Shortcuts:

- `@api`: Expands to a nested test class with a display name for a specific API endpoint.
- `@method`: Expands to a nested test class with a display name for a specific method.
- `@when`: Expands to a nested test class with a display name for a specific condition.
- `@then`: Expands to a test method with a display name for a specific assertion.

This template is designed to streamline Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices within IntelliJ IDEA and VS Code, making the process of writing tests and code more efficient and structured.

#### About the Template

This TDD template includes helpful shortcuts and structures to facilitate TDD practices, ensuring that your testing process is seamless and organized. The template consists of predefined snippets that can be easily expanded to create test classes and methods, following the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern commonly used in TDD.

#### How to Use

1. **Installation**: Download the `TDD-Templates-For-IntelliJ.zip` file.
   
2. **Import Settings in IntelliJ IDEA**:
   - Open IntelliJ IDEA.
   - Go to `File` > `Import Settings`.
   - Select the downloaded `TDD-Templates-For-IntelliJ.zip` file.
   - Follow the prompts to import the settings.

3. **Usage**: In your test classes, utilize the predefined snippets to structure your tests effectively.
   
   - `@api`: Expands to a nested test class with a display name for a specific API endpoint.
   
     ```java
     @Nested
     @DisplayName("GET /users")
     class GetUsersTest {
     
     }
     ```
   
   - `@method`: Expands to a nested test class with a display name for a specific method, with placeholders for method names.
   
     ```java
     @Nested
     @DisplayName("{userMethods} method")
     class {UserMethods}MethodTest {
     
     }
     ```
   
   - `@when`: Expands to a nested test class with a display name for a specific condition, with placeholders for condition descriptions.
   
     ```java
     @Nested
     @DisplayName("WHEN {condition description}")
     class {ConditionDescription}Tests {
     
     }
     ```
   
   - `@then`: Expands to a test method with a display name for a specific assertion, with placeholders for assertion descriptions.
   
     ```java
     @Test
     @DisplayName("THEN {assertion description}")
     void {AssertionDescription}Test() {
         // given
         {code for setting conditions describe in WHEN block}
     
         // when
         {code for running actions}
     
         // then
         {code for assertions}
     }
     ```
